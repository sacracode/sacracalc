# 📊 SacraCalc – Compare Fiat vs BTC Value Over Time

SacraCalc is a simple, mobile-friendly calculator that lets anyone see how their local currency (MXN, USD, EUR, CAD, BRICS) loses value over time — and how much more purchasing power they could gain if they exchanged that money into Bitcoin.

## 🧠 How it Works

Just enter:
- An amount of money
- Your local currency
- A timeframe (e.g., 1 year, 5 years, or custom)

You'll get:
- Live BTC price
- Future BTC growth estimate
- Inflation impact on fiat
- Purchasing power loss
- Easy-to-understand comparison graphs
